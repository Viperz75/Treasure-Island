So he jumps on a ship and starts his new adventure on finding that island. A few weeks later the storm started at sea. His ship was wrecked in that storm. He loses his conciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself in a island. He has no idea what to do now. He went inside the island and saw some similarities with his map of treasure island.
