So he jumps on a ship and starts his new adventure on finding that island. A few weeks later the storm started at sea. His ship was wrecked in that storm. He loses his consciousness. When he wakes up, he finds himself on an island. He has no idea what to do now. He went inside the island and saw some similarities with his map of the treasure island.
